<h2>Flyway Database Migrations using Flyway API</h2>

This repo is an exercise in database migrations using the Flyway API.

The aim of the project is to get a better how to build, update and populate a database using Flyway.

Instead of having to run a specific migrate command (as I did in the Flyway Gradle plugin repo), the Flyway migration is now configured to run when the application runs. 

This feels like a more 'real-world' use case.
