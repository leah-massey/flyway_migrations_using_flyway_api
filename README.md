<h2>Flyway Database Migrations using Flyway API</h2>

This repo is an exercise in database migrations using the Flyway API. 

The aim of the project is to get a better understanding of how Flyway works and how I can use it in real-world projects.

I'm looking at building, populating and updating database tables using the Flyway.
